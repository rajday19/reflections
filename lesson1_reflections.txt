How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

I need to re-check again

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

1. We get to see the progress made by each version
2. Can easily go back to an earlier version if the later version has a bug
3. Saves a lot of time trying to clean the bug

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

Logical changes can be changed
Greater flexibility
Will not be saved randomly or have too many copies

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

Git is specially geared toward coding. Hence they take care of inter dependency in files


How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

Makes you free of worry abut breaking code. Enables you to work faster

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
Keep track of my projects
